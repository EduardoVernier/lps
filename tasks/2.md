 This is quite a nice plot, it shows geographical and time related data.
 
 I thought  the sentences at the bottom right are a bit confusing. The claims are are true only up until the moment pointed out by the grey dot.  
 The yellow code is a bit confusing, as in the map it represents the Las Vegas shooting (585+ victims), in the pie chart it represents all victims in Nevada (597+) and in the timeline it represents all victims in 2017, regardless of place (615+ victims).
